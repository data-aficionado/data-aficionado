# Hello World! :wave:

## My ü¶æ 
    Perseverance is not just a willingness to endure hardship, but the fortitude to face the storm, to outlast it, and to emerge not just unscathed but victorious. Within the heart of every struggle lies the seed of opportunity, a promise that amidst the trials and tribulations, resilience and grit become the architects of our destiny. Life doesn't just challenge us to endure; it invites us to thrive, to grasp the miracles that are already here, already now. Hold fast to the pursuit of your dreams, for the moment you're ready to quit is often the moment right before the miracle unfolds. So let's live not just by the light of our hopes, but by the strength of our will. Remember, the universe conspires to favor the relentless, and every step taken in persistence is a step towards a miracle in wait. Keep going, for everything you seek is within reach, right here, right now. We live for such miracles.
   



#### Welcome to my data-aficionado! :sparkles: 

üî≠ I'm currently working on an amazing machine learning project to find the molecular signature of Oxaliplatin Induced Neurotoxicity

üå± I'm currently  busy learning everything about Data Science and Aadvanced Predictive Modeling Techniques with LLMs and Gen AI

## ‚ö° Fun facts about me

I love coding at sunrise. :sunrise:

I've perfected the art of snowman architecture during the winter months, creating frosty masterpieces that might just give data models a run for their money! ‚õÑÔ∏è 

I'm an avid collector of autumn leaves, and I have a scrapbook filled with colorful specimens from different parts of the world ‚Äì it's my own kind of natural dataset! üçÅ üçÇ üçÉ 

Inspired by the serene beauty of falling snow, I once organized a snowflake photography session, capturing the intricate designs of snow crystals ‚Äì nature's way of showing off its meticulous patterns! ‚ùÑÔ∏è
